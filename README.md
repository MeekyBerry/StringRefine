# Project Overview
* This project is a React.js app with two screens. The first screen takes user input and, upon submission, redirects to screen two, which displays the entered string as cards. Each card displays a single character from the string, and each character's duplicate instances can be removed by clicking the delete icon. If a character has no duplicates, it will remain on the screen. If there are no duplicate characters in the string, a success header is displayed. The original and updated strings are also displayed.
